## Key Eclipse Configuration Tips

1. **Java Version Compliance**:
   - Right-click project → Properties → Java Compiler
   - Ensure "Compiler compliance level" matches your JRE version

2. **Adding Resources**:
   - For icons/images: Right-click project → New → Folder → Name: "resources"
   - Mark as "Source Folder" (right-click → Build Path → Use as Source Folder)

3. **Debugging**:
   - Set breakpoints by clicking left margin
   - Run → Debug (F11) to start debugging
   - Use F5 (step into), F6 (step over) during debugging

This Eclipse-specific setup ensures your Swing application runs properly within the IDE environment while maintaining all the functionality of your grade tracking system.
